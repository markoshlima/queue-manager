**Architecture Infraestructure**

![alt text](https://github.com/markoshlima/queue-manager/blob/master/docs/Architecture%20Infraestructure/Architecture%20Infraestructure.png?raw=true)

All resources is inside a VPC in sa-east-1 (SÃ£o Paulo) region.
Route Table to route trafic between public and private using a NAT Instance.
Two private and two public subnet in two distinct availibility zones for high disponibility.
In privete subnets there are private servers such as storages and functions.
In public subnets there are public servers such as Jenkins and Bastions Hosts.

**Architecture Application**

![](https://github.com/markoshlima/queue-manager/blob/master/docs/Architecture%20Application/Architecture%20Application.png?raw=true)

All requests for the system, is behing a Content Delivery Network (Cloudfront), to serve low latency and security for static and dynamic content.

Apresentation Layer
For client frontend, it is using React, and for Backoffice frontend it is Angular 6, both hosted in S3 bucket.

All Lambda requests is behind an API Proxy, using API Gateway, and RestFul best practices. There is an interceptor authenticator (JWT)  written in Python using Lambda Function for private requests.

Application Layer
All backend application is in Lambda Functions written in Python, except the Mailer function, that is written in NodeJS.
The user and e-mailing intelligence is event driven architecture, using SQS to disengage.
All Lambda functions are distribuited from two availibility zones for high disponibility.

Storage Layer
DynamoDB: For store user information, the structure need to be flexible and elastic. 
RDS (MySQL): It is for store data about queue and client persistent information, large queries and unions is required.
ElastiCache (Redis): It is using for delivery client and position information, low latency and high throughput is required.

**Loggin and Monitoring**

![alt text](https://github.com/markoshlima/queue-manager/blob/master/docs/Logging%20and%20Monitoring/Logging%20and%20Monitoring.png?raw=true)
Databases:
For MySQL and Redis databases, all metrics is sending (for default) to CloudWatch Metrics. These metrics above are monitored for CloudWatch Alarms.

RDS
CPUUtilization, DatabaseConnections, FreeStorageSpace, ReadIOPS, WriteIOPS

Elasticache
CPUUtilization, Evictions, CacheMisses.

If some metric overcome the max values, a notification is sent to SNS, in witch will notify an user.

Apart these itens, the user can get metric data for every service from AWS in use.

Events:
All events is using SQS queue for desangage systems, but if an event can't be released to next microservice, this event will be sent to a dead letter queue (after three times of threshould). An topic from SNS subscribed to these dead letter queues, will notify an user.

App Functions:
CloudWatch Logs capture all logs from Lambda Functions. All these functions is subscribed to ElasticSearch, that send these logs through an other Lambda Function. Kibana is avalaible for data visualization, user can troubleshooting through this tool.

**Pricing**

All resources were priced in AWS Calculator, the following link, there is the final price of this architecture, excluding Lambda, SQS, S3 and Cloudfront services, because it is Free Tier Elegible or the value is low to input in this pricing.
