# **Introduction**

Queue Manager is a system to manage queues as the name implies, aimed at users who want to perform queue control for bars, restaurants, nightclubs and so on. Below are images of some screens of the system in operation.

# **Infraestructure Architecture**

![alt text](https://github.com/markoshlima/queue-manager/blob/master/docs/Architecture%20Infraestructure/Architecture%20Infraestructure.png?raw=true)

  - All resources is inside a VPC in sa-east-1 (SÃ£o Paulo) region.
  - Route Table to route trafic between public and private using a NAT Instance.
  - Two private and two public subnet in two distinct availibility zones for high disponibility.
  - In private subnets there are private servers such as storages and functions.
  - In public subnets there are public servers such as Nat Instance and Bastion Host.

# **Application Component Architecture**

All requests for the system, is behing a Content Delivery Network (Cloudfront), to serve low latency and security for static and dynamic content.

**Apresentation Layer:** 
For client frontend, it is using React, and for Backoffice frontend it is Angular 6, both hosted in S3 bucket.
All Lambda requests is behind an API Proxy, using API Gateway, and RestFul best practices. There is an interceptor authenticator (JWT)  written in Python using Lambda Function for private requests.

**Application Layer:** 
All backend application is in Lambda Functions written in Python, except the Mailer function, that is written in NodeJS.
The user and e-mailing intelligence is event driven architecture, using SQS.
All Lambda functions are distribuited from two availibility zones for high disponibility.
All confidential information such as password and database host and encryption key are stored in System Manager Parameter Store for greater security, traceability and maintenance.

**Storage Layer:** 
DynamoDB: For store user information, the structure need to be flexible and elastic. 
RDS (MySQL): It is for store data about queue and client persistent information, large queries and unions is required.
ElastiCache (Redis): It is using for delivery client and position information, low latency and high throughput is required.

# **Microservice Architecture**

![alt text](https://github.com/markoshlima/queue-manager/blob/master/docs/Architecture%20Microservice/Architecture%20Microservice.png?raw=true)

Microservice architecture, applications are broken down into smaller, independent and uncoupled components. Applicable model for high scalability and maintenance. All microservices are serveless functions.

# **Logging and Monitoring**

![alt text](https://github.com/markoshlima/queue-manager/blob/master/docs/Logging%20and%20Monitoring/Logging%20and%20Monitoring.png?raw=true)

**Databases:** 
For MySQL and Redis databases, all metrics is sending (for default) to CloudWatch Metrics. These metrics above are monitored in CloudWatch Alarms.
RDS: CPUUtilization, DatabaseConnections, FreeStorageSpace, ReadIOPS, WriteIOPS
Elasticache: CPUUtilization, Evictions, CacheMisses.
If some metric overcome the max values, a notification is sent to SNS, in witch will notify an user.
Apart these itens, the user can get metric data for every service from AWS in use.

**Events:** 
All events is using SQS, but if an event can't be released to next microservice, this event will be sent to a dead letter queue (after three times of threshould). An topic from SNS subscribed to these dead letter queues, will notify an user.

**App Functions:** 
CloudWatch Logs capture all logs from Lambda Functions. All these functions is subscribed to ElasticSearch, that send these logs through an other Lambda Function. Kibana is avalaible for data visualization, user can troubleshooting through this tool.

# **Pricing**

All resources were priced in AWS Calculator, the following link, the final price of this architecture, excluding Lambda, SQS, S3 and Cloudfront services, because it is Free Tier Elegible or the value is low to input in this pricing cotation.

# Addition Information & Setup

The project is for lab and studies, it is not operating so as not to keep costs in production. That's a reason not existing a Continuos Develivy implemented too.

To setup the environment:
  - Use folder /Iaac in this repository (Infraestructure as a Code) to publish the MySQL, DynamoDB and Redis databases, and also SQS queues in AWS CloudFormation.
  - In DynamoDB create two table: customer and pre-customer.
  - Create these parameters in AWS SSM Parameter Store:MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_USER, REDIS_HOST, TOKEN_KEY.
  - In Lambda functions there is the SAM Template for creating (CloudFormation) the backend applications as well. (Change URL SQS references)
  - Frontent: Create the buckets and AWS CloudFormation for static delivery.
  - Create other CloudFront to serve backend endpoints, pointing to API-GATEWAY
